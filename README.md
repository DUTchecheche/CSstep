CSstep: Step-by-step exploration of the chemical space of drug molecules via multi-agent and multi-stage reinforcement learning
===
CSstep is a drug molecule generation/optimization framework based on the Markov decision process and deep reinforcement learning. CSstep is inspired by Zhou et al. , Jeon et al. , and Fang et al.

By combining a multi-agent joint decision strategy and a multi-stage fine-tuning strategy in this framework, the trade-offs among multiple objective properties during the molecular optimization process and the complete exploration process are visualized in chemical space maps, which is expected to provide more chemical insights for drug discovery and inspire solution ideas for general multi-objective optimization problems. 
CSstep can achieve step-by-step, directed, and intelligent exploration of the drug-like molecular chemical space.

Usage:

(1) Download this repository and unzip it.

(2) Create and activate a new conda environment:
```
conda create --name CSstep python=3.7

conda activate CSstep
```
(3) Install necessary dependencies:

pytorch 1.13.1:
```
conda install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```
or
```
conda install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 cpuonly -c pytorch
```
others:
```
pip install rdkit==2022.9.5 pandas==1.3.5 matplotlib==3.5.3
```
options: 

pymol 3.1.0a0, for get_pocket_using_pymol.py

This library can only be used in an environment where the PyMol software is installed.

Download PyMol 3.1: https://www.pymol.org/

(4) Enter the directory where CSstep.py is located:
```
cd <the directory where CSstep.py is located>
```
(5) Read the help information:
```
python CSstep.py -h
```
(6) Run a De novo molecular generation process:
```
python CSstep.py --output_path .\test_results --pocket_file .\case1\nilotinib_pocket6A.pdb --max_episode 8000
```
or (6) Run a molecular optimization process:
```
python CSstep.py --output_path .\test_results --pocket_file .\case1\nilotinib_pocket6A.pdb --init_smi CC1=C(C=C(C=C1)C(=O)NC2=CC(=CC(=C2)C(F)(F)F)N3C=C(N=C3)C)NC4=NC=CC(=N4)C5=CN=CC=C5 --program_name Nilotinib
```
The pocket file can be automatically generated by using the script: get_pocket_using_pymol.py. The amino acid residues within 6 A of the ligand in a crystal structure will be saved as the pocket file. Or, key residues that make up a binding pocket can be manually selected and saved as a separate pdb format file in any visualization software (e.g., PyMol or VMD). Our model is robust to the pocket input, but we still recommend selecting 10~40 key residues that make up the binding site.
(7) Find result files in the output path:
